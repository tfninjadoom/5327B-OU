## Git commands
The following cheatsheet on using git to interact with your codebase requires:  
- Git to be installed on your laptop  
- A separate folder within your desktop to host any and all of your GitHub-linked projects  

Make sure all git commands are entered in the `bash` terminal within VS Code.  

### Update your local branch with repo ( git pull )  
To get the latest version of the code from the repository, use `git pull`.  

### Saving your changes ( git add -A  &  git commit -m )  
To stage all changes (local save), use `git add -A`.  
  
To save a complete set of changes in a commit, use `git commit -m "Commit Message"`. Alternatively, go to the Source Control tab on the sidebar and press the commit button.  
DO NOT commit your changes without a brief, informative message explaining the changes in the text box above the commit button.  

### Syncing your commits to the repo ( git push )  
To publish your changes to the repository for all, use `git push` or press the blue "Sync changes" button.  

### Switching branches ( git checkout -b )  
To switch to a different branch of development, use `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.  

### Creating local copy of repo ( git clone <repo_link> )  
To create a local copy of a pre-existing repository, use the green "Code" button to get the github link of the repository.  
Then, use `git clone <repo_link>` to create a local clone of the repo to work on.
